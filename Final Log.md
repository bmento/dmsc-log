## FINAL PROJECT LOG


# Inspirations

In the begining of the semsester we talked a lot about emergence and interactive enviorments and my project for that was to create a duck pond that would have bread that they could eat. One of my favorite games is untitled goose game, where you get to run around do fun things as a goose. I loved the artstyle and the basic premise of the game so I felt like making my own (much less cool) version of it. We also needed to have procedural generation so I felt that the map was the easiest to impliment for that task. My game is based on the grid generation that we went over in class and has 5 levels of increasing dificulty. (pictured below)
