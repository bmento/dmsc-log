## Class Notes
Notes from class 


5/6/21
Alright so I have clearly not touched this log since the first weeks of class and thats my fault. I missed half of the 2nd week becuase my house flooded and then becuase of that I was displaced and couldn't make it to class the following week. These early absents definitely set me behind and while trying to manage with other classes, my job, and my home life, I just struggled to find the time to catch up. My plan is to go through the assignments where I was to post on here and explain what I did at the time, becuse I was doing the coding for this class, I just completely fotgot to update this in the process.
