## Class Notes
Notes from class 


5/6/21
Alright so I have clearly not touched this log since the first weeks of class and thats my fault. I missed half of the 2nd week becuase my house flooded and then becuase of that I was displaced and couldn't make it to class the following week. These early absents definitely set me behind and while trying to manage with other classes, my job, and my home life, I just struggled to find the time to catch up. My plan is to go through the assignments where I was to post on here and explain what I did at the time, becuse I was doing the coding for this class, I just completely fotgot to update this in the process.







## FINAL PROJECT LOG


# Inspirations

In the begining of the semsester we talked a lot about emergence and interactive enviorments and my project for that was to create a duck pond that would have bread that they could eat. One of my favorite games is untitled goose game, where you get to run around do fun things as a goose. I loved the artstyle and the basic premise of the game so I felt like making my own (much less cool) version of it. We also needed to have procedural generation so I felt that the map was the easiest to impliment for that task. My game is based on the grid generation that we went over in class and has 5 levels of increasing dificulty. (pictured below)
