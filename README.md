## Class Notes
Notes from class 


5/6/21
Alright so I have clearly not touched this log since the first weeks of class and thats my fault. I missed half of the 2nd week becuase my house flooded and then becuase of that I was displaced and couldn't make it to class the following week. These early absents definitely set me behind and while trying to manage with other classes, my job, and my home life, I just struggled to find the time to catch up. My plan is to go through the assignments where I was to post on here and explain what I did at the time, becuse I was doing the coding for this class, I just completely fotgot to update this in the process.


## Squirell Group Project Log

This the devolg post for my work and experience working on the squirel project. I worked with Chris, Monty, and Quincy.  We first started out by
making a google drive file where we could post all of the planning and coding with each other. The first class we each took our own task and worked 
on them individually, but asked each other for help. While I wasn't to confident at coming up with the more complex probelms, I worked on getting player/
enemy movement. Chris and Quincy worked on how the squirells would eat one another and subsequently grow in size, while Monty worked on how the squirells 
would look. All of our code was in the google drive so each were running our own version of the game. This was about as far as we got and class and then 
we didn't meet up again until before the next class where Lee gave us time to work on it some more. Quincy had the most complete version of what we had 
worked on prior so we decided to use his as the main code. In the time before class we worked on some of the final things that we felt we could get done and 
Quincy finalized the code. 

here is the link to the code:

## FINAL PROJECT LOG

# Inspirations

In the begining of the semsester we talked a lot about emergence and interactive enviorments and my project for that was to create a duck pond that would have bread that they could eat. One of my favorite games is untitled goose game, where you get to run around do fun things as a goose. I loved the artstyle and the basic premise of the game so I felt like making my own (much less cool) version of it. We also needed to have procedural generation so I felt that the map was the easiest to impliment for that task. My game is based on the grid generation that we went over in class and has 5 levels of increasing dificulty. (pictured below)
