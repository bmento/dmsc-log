This the devolg post for my work and experience working on the squirel project. I worked with Chris, Monty, and Quincy.  We first started out by
making a google drive file where we could post all of the planning and coding with each other. The first class we each took our own task and worked 
on them individually, but asked each other for help. While I wasn't to confident at coming up with the more complex probelms, I worked on getting player/
enemy movement. Chris and Quincy worked on how the squirells would eat one another and subsequently grow in size, while Monty worked on how the squirells 
would look. All of our code was in the google drive so each were running our own version of the game. This was about as far as we got and class and then 
we didn't meet up again until before the next class where Lee gave us time to work on it some more. Quincy had the most complete version of what we had 
worked on prior so we decided to use his as the main code. In the time before class we worked on some of the final things that we felt we could get done and 
Quincy finalized the code. 

here is the link to the code:
